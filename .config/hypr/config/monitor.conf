# Multi-computer monitor configuration based on hostname
# Create a symlink: ln -sf ~/.config/hypr/config/monitors/$(hostname).conf ~/.config/hypr/config/monitors/current.conf
# Then uncomment the line below and comment out the hostname-specific source
source = ~/.config/hypr/config/monitors/current.conf

# Alternatively, manually update this line to match your hostname:
# source = ~/.config/hypr/config/monitors/cachyos-xps15.conf


# If you need to scale things like steam etc, please uncomment these lines.
#xwayland {
#  force_zero_scaling = true       # Unscale XWayland
#}

# Adjust GDK_SCALE accordingly to your liking.
#env = GDK_SCALE, 2                # GDK Scaling Factor (no fractional scaling)

# Electron based apps use X11 as default, auto should detect wayland
