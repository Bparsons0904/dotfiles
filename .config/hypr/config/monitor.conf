# Monitor wiki https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/

# Multi-computer monitor configuration
# Each computer needs its own local.conf (gitignored)
#
# To set up a new computer:
# 1. Copy a template: cp ~/.config/hypr/config/monitors/cachyos-xps15.conf ~/.config/hypr/config/monitors/local.conf
# 2. Edit local.conf for your monitor setup
# 3. Run: hyprctl reload
#
# Example configs to copy from: cachyos-xps15.conf, cachyos-x8664.conf, miracachy.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/config/monitors/local.conf


# If you need to scale things like steam etc, please uncomment these lines.
#xwayland {
#  force_zero_scaling = true       # Unscale XWayland
#}

# Adjust GDK_SCALE accordingly to your liking.
#env = GDK_SCALE, 2                # GDK Scaling Factor (no fractional scaling)

# Electron based apps use X11 as default, auto should detect wayland
env = ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT, auto
